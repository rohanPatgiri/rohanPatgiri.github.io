        <p>PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>
        Nairobi, Kenya's capital, has a complex public transportation system including matatus (minibuses), buses, and the newly introduced Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system.
         The city's population of over 4 million relies heavily on these services, but they can be challenging to navigate, especially for
          people with invisible disabilities.
<br> <br>
          People with invisible disabilities (e.g., autism, chronic pain, hearing impairments) often struggle to communicate their needs in Nairobi's 
          fast-paced and crowded  public transportation system. 
          This leads to misunderstandings, lack of accommodation, and potentially dangerous situations.
<br><br >
          This project aims to leverage mobile and AI technologies to address a critical urban accessibility challenge in Nairobi,
           potentially improving the daily lives of thousands of people with invisible disabilities while also raising public 
        awareness and promoting a more inclusive society.
