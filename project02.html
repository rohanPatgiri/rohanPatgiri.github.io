        PROBLEM STATEMENT/ SCENARIO
      </p>
      <p>
        The Global Counter-Terrorism Alliance (GCTA) has launched an ambitious initiative to identify and address emerging threats across the globe. As part of this effort, the organization has tasked its Data Intelligence Division with analyzing the Global Terrorism Dataset, a comprehensive repository of around 190,000 records of terror incidents spanning five decades.

        Context:
        I am a Data Analyst working in the Data Intelligence Division. I have been entrusted with the critical task of performing an in-depth 
        exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover key patterns, identify high-risk regions (hot zones), and generate actionable 
        insights. The insights derived will will be presented to the GCTA executive team, 
        which will inform security policy decisions and guide resource allocation to counteract terrorism effectively.

        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
      </p>
      <p>
        This report summarizes key trends in global terrorism from 1970 to 2017 to inform counter-terrorism strategies and international security summits. The Middle East and North Africa, along with South Asia, have been the most frequent targets of terrorist attacks. Specifically, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have suffered the highest number of attacks. The most impacted cities include Baghdad, Karachi, and Lima, highlighting the urban concentration of terrorist activity. The data reveals private citizens and property as the most common targets (24% of attacks), followed by military personnel (15%). This suggests a shift towards tactics aimed at generating widespread fear and disruption. The Taliban, ISIL, and Shining Path emerge as the most active terrorist groups, demanding focused attention from counter-terrorism efforts. Analysis of attack types reveals a preponderance of bombings and explosions (48.57%) and armed assaults (23.5%).
         This emphasizes the need for strategies to disrupt the acquisition and deployment of explosives and firearms by terrorist organizations.
