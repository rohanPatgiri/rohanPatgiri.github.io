        PROBLEM STATEMENT

        Datastore Inc., a nationwide retail company operating in the United States, has experienced fluctuating profits over the last fiscal year. The company operates across multiple states across the country and offers a diverse range of products. Despite solid sales in certain regions, losses in others have raised concerns among executives. To address these issues, Datastore Inc. seeks to identify under-performing areas and implement strategies to improve profitability.
        
        TASK
        In this scenario, I am a data analyst at Datastore Inc. and my goal is to conduct a thorough analysis of the company's data, identify weak areas, and propose actionable recommendations.
        
        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
        The analysis reveals significant profit gaps across regions, customer segments, and product categories. The Central region and 10 states, including Texas and Ohio, reported the lowest profits, with 22.8% of cities being loss-making. Targeted cost-reduction strategies, operational optimizations, and localized promotions are recommended to address these issues. The Consumer segment is the most profitable, while the Home Office and Corporate segments show growth potential, necessitating focused marketing and pricing strategies.
         Furniture profits lag behind other categories, requiring revised pricing, targeted campaigns, and supply chain optimizations to improve margins. These measures aim to enhance overall profitability and operational efficiency.
